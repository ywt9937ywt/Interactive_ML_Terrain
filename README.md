# Interactive_ML_Terrain

Introduction:

It is currently a pytorch version of WGAN model for automatically generating Height Map or digital elevation model(DEM) for terrain. In the future, it will be gradually updated to a CGAN model and accept user sketch inputs which is to indicate river and ridge. 

Dependance:

1. h5py: This module allows to store large quantity of DEMs and allows very fast read and write.
   
2. pytorch: pytorch is very powerful module for machine learning coding. Compared to TensorFlow,       imcompatibility seldom occurs.

I will complete this document gradually.
